I'm currently working as a software engineer at an augmented reality startup.

Some facts about me:

- My academic background is in physics and mathematics.
- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segfault".
- I'm building an [options trading bot](https://github.com/cm-jones/thales) in my spare time.

Contact me at codymjones@pm.me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones) for opportunities to collaborate.
