Hi! My name is Cody, and I'm currently a software developer at Panama, Inc., an augmented reality startup in Chicago, IL, USA.

Some quick facts about me:

- My academic background is in physics and math, not computer science.
- My favorite (and first) programming language is C. It was "love at first segfault". Slowly learning Rust.
- I've had a long-standing interest in quantitative finance, so I'm building an [options trading bot](https://github.com/cm-jones/thales) in my spare time.

Feel free to contact me at codymjones@pm.me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones) if you want to collaborate on a project!
