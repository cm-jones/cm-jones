Hi! My name is Cody Jones. ðŸ‘‹

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and mathematics. As a result, I have always loved the theoretical side of computer science.
- I am keenly interested in the intersection between finance and technology. I believe this is where technology finds its maximum power and raison d'Ãªtre.

Don't hesitate to contact me at codymjones@pm.me for opportunities to collaborate. Alternatively, you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones).
