I'm currently working as a software engineer at an augmented reality startup.

Some facts about me:

- My academic background is in physics and math. General Relativity was the most challenging and rewarding class I ever took.
- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- I'm currently working on an options trading bot (see [thales](https://github.com/cm-jones/thales)).
