Hey! 👋🏻

My name is Cody and I'm a software engineer based in Chicago, IL, USA.

Some facts about me:

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and math. As a result, I've always loved the theoretical side of computer science.
- I'm interested in the intersection between finance and technology. I believe that the financial sector is where technology finds its maximum utility.
- I love to lift weights and I can speak Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic as well as the Levantine dialect).

Please don't hesitate to contact me at codymjones@pm.me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones) with opportunities to collaborate.
