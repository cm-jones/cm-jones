## üëã About Me

Hey! My name is Cody and I'm a software engineer based in Chicago, IL, USA.

Some facts about me:

- My academic background is in physics and mathematics (I have a B.S. in Computational Physics), so I've always had a passion for the theoretical side of computer science.
- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault". I love working as close as possible to the hardware from a software perspective.
- My professional interests lie at the intersection between technology and finance. I'm currently working on an algorithmic options trading bot (see options-bot below). It's my ambition to one day start my own company.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Personal Projects

- [libdsc](https://github.com/cm-jones/libdsc) (released): implementations of data structures not found in `libc`
- [lincpp](https://github.com/cm-jones/lincpp) (in progress): a numerical linear algebra library
- [options-bot](https://github.com/cm-jones/options-bot) (in progress): an algorithmic options trading bot
- [mta-tracker](https://github.com/cm-jones/mta-tracker) (released): an Android app displaying information about train arrivals on the NYC Subway

## ü§ù Open-Source Contributions

Working on personal projects is fun, but there's nothing more rewarding than building something cool with a group of smart people. Here are some of the projects I've contributed to:

- [axel](https://github.com/axel-download-accelerator/axel): a CLI download accelerator
- [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl): the well-known TLS/SSL and crypto library
