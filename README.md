I'm currently working as a software engineer at an augmented reality startup.

Some facts about me:

- My academic background is in physics and math.
- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- I'm currently working on an options trading bot (see `thales` below).

Please don't hesitate to contact me at codymjones@pm.me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones) for opportunities to collaborate.
