I'm currently a software engineer at Panama, Inc., an augmented reality startup.

- My academic background is in physics and math.
- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segfault". Slowly learning Rust.
- I'm building an [options trading bot](https://github.com/cm-jones/thales) in my spare time.
