Hey! 👋🏻

My name is Cody and I'm a software engineer based in Chicago, IL, USA.

Some facts about me:

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and mathematics. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for theoretical computer science.
- I'm extremely interested in the intersection between finance and technology. I believe finance is where technology finds its maximum power.
