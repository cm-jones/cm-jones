## 👋🏻  About Me

Hey! My name is Cody and I'm a software engineer based in Chicago, IL, USA.

Some facts about me:

- My academic background is in physics and mathematics (I have a B.S. in Computational Physics), so I've always had a passion for the theoretical side of computer science.
- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault". I love interacting with hardware from a software perspective.
- My professional interests lie at the intersection between technology and finance. I'm currently working on an algorithmic options trading bot (see options-bot below).

## 👨🏼‍💻  Personal Projects

- [libdsc](https://github.com/cm-jones/libdsc) (released)

## 🤝  Contributions to Open-Source Projects

Although working on personal projects is fun in its own way, there's nothing more rewarding than building something cool with a group of smart people. Here are just some of the open-source projects I've contributed to:

- [axel](https://github.com/axel-download-accelerator/axel)
- [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
