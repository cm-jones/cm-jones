Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cody and I'm a software developer based in Chicago.

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and math. As a result, I've always loved the theoretical side of computer science.
- I'm keenly interested in the intersection of finance and technology. I believe finance is where technology finds its maximum utility.
