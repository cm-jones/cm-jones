Hi! My name is Cody Jones. ðŸ‘‹

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and mathematics. As a result, I have always loved theoretical computer science.
- I am keenly interested in the intersection between finance and technology. I believe this is where IT finds its maximum power.

Don't hesitate to contact me at codymjones@pm.me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones) for opportunities to collaborate.
