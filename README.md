ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Cody Jones and I'm a software developer based in Chicago.

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and mathematics. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for the theoretical side of computer science.
- My professional interests lie at the intersection of finance and technology. I believe that the world of finance, especially decentralized finance, is where technology finds its maximum utility.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at codymjones@pm.me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cm-jones) for opportunities to collaborate.
