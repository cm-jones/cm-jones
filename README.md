Hi! My name is Cody Jones. ðŸ‘‹

- My favorite programming language is C. It was "love at first segmentation fault".
- My academic background is in physics and mathematics. As a result, I have always loved theoretical computer science.
- I am keenly interested in the intersection between finance and technology. I believe this domain is where technology finds its maximum power.
